# TicketBlaster

## About

TicketBlaster is a full-stack application for purchasing tickets to musical concerts and stand-up comedy shows.
It was developed as the final project for the SemosAcademy JavaScript course.

## Design

The application's design is based on this prototype: https://xd.adobe.com/view/7e6e2246-7682-45ad-991d-2f9d75f01372-2b3d/

## Preview

Backend: Built using Express.js. Start the server with `npm start`.
Frontend: Developed with React and Vite. To run the frontend download the files and navigate to the web folder, then run `pnpm dev`.

## Disclaimer

This was my first major project and my first ever full-stack application. Please note that it is not a fully completed product, as there are still some features missing. I may continue working on it in the future.
